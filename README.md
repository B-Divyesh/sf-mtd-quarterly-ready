# Quarterly Ready

Turn UK business records into a checked quarterly update.

Quarterly Ready is for sole traders, tutors, and landlords preparing for Making Tax Digital. It keeps one quarter focused: capture records, review categories, check totals, and prepare an accountant handoff.

It does not give tax advice or submit directly to HMRC. The handoff file is for an accountant or HMRC-recognised software.

## Try the demo

Open `http://localhost:8080/demo` after starting the app. The hosted demo is at <https://mtd-quarterly-ready.sociobot.in/demo>.

The sample is a tutoring business with ten realistic transactions. One category and one receipt need attention.

Demo changes use the `demo:quarterly-ready:document` browser key. They never read or write real workspace data.

## What v1 includes

- Manual transaction and receipt capture.
- Bank CSV import.
- Income, cost, and net quarter totals.
- Category and receipt checks with explicit human review.
- A complete accountant CSV download.
- A reviewed JSON handoff for HMRC-recognised software.
- Read-only accountant links with a 30-day expiry.
- Encrypted SQLite documents and a hash-chained audit log.
- An offline browser copy after the first visit.

The free version keeps one working quarter and all downloads. A £99 one-time licence adds live accountant links. Checkout and licence checks use the Sociobot billing API.

## Run locally

Requirements: Node 22+, npm, and Rust 1.88+.

```sh
npm install
npm run build
PORT=8080 cargo run
```

Then open <http://localhost:8080>. No environment variables are required.

For frontend work, run the API and Vite in separate terminals:

```sh
PORT=8080 cargo run
npm run dev
```

## Test

```sh
npm test
```

This runs TypeScript unit tests, Rust tests, a clean frontend build, Playwright claim tests, and Axe checks. Claim definitions live in [`.factory/claims.json`](.factory/claims.json).

## Container

```sh
docker build --build-arg BUILD_SHA=$(git rev-parse --short HEAD) -t quarterly-ready .
docker run --rm -p 8080:8080 -v quarterly-ready-data:/data quarterly-ready
```

The container runs as a non-root user and listens on `PORT`. `/health` returns the build SHA.

## Data and configuration

The server defaults to `/data` in the container and `./data` locally. It creates its AES-256-GCM key on first boot and stores it with restricted permissions.

Optional variables are `DATA_DIR` and `FRONTEND_DIR`. `PORT` defaults to `8080`.
